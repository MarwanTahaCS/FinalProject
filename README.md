# FinalProject

This our final OOP C++ game project of second year of CS degree, we were a group 
  of 3 students, We built the project using C++ and SFML library.
The project is a battle Game, where the player fights an enemy Algorithm trying to
  brake each other's castles, Allied Castle is on the right of the screen, while 
  enemy Castle is on the left, you pay money for sending soldiers to battle, and 
  once in a while you get to send a special air attack.
  we gave the enemy agorithm extra money and less cooldown on special air attacks,
  which made it impossible to defeat, so dont feel bad if you lose, we had barely
  2 weeks to get submit the project, so we didnt have time to modify it.
